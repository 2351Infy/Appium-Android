This code will scroll downwards, you can specify how many times you wish for it to scroll by placing it into a for loop. 
Only downside is that it is a nonspecific code. Again, this code is from one of their github answers, 
and as I mentioned, Appium is incapable of doing any proper scrolls for iOS. At least, 
I haven't located anything.
